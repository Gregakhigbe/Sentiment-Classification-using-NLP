# Sentiment-Classification-using-NLP
Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that involves automatically classifying text according to the emotional tone expressed. In this project, the specific problem is binary sentiment classification of Twitter posts (tweets) as positive or negative. Tweets are short (originally up to 140 characters) informal messages often containing misspellings, slang, emoticons and hashtags. Sentiment analysis systems should infer overall attitude or emotion (e.g. satisfaction vs dissatisfaction) from each tweet’s text. In practice this involves preprocessing the text and training a classifier to predict the tweet’s polarity (positive or negative) from its content.
This report focuses on sentiment analysis in Twitter data, which is a challenging social-media domain of NLP. Rather than generic product reviews, we concentrate on tweets because such a language is notoriously hard to quantify because tweets are short, casual, and often sarcastic or misspelled. This makes sentiment signals “resistant to quantification” compared to longer formal text. For example, companies use tweet sentiment to monitor brand reputation in real time; capturing this in NLP models is valuable but difficult due to the informal style. The scope here is to build and compare classifiers for positive/negative tweet sentiment. This contributes meaningfully because robust Twitter sentiment tools remain an active research area. A simple statement like “movie reviews” (common in sentiment study) is too narrow; focusing on Twitter addresses underexplored issues like brevity and evolving slang.
